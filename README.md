# SensorPlotting
Plot Tranmsission Spectra from txt / csv files in 3 potential figure formats

1. Transmission - starting point for plotting data from one measurement (one device)
2. SensingTransmission_OneExperiment - plot data from all devices on one sample (e.g. n waveguides, 1 experimental trial)
3. SensingTransmission_NExperiments - plot data from all devices on one sample over multiple experimental attempts (e.g. n waveguides, N experimental trials / steps)
